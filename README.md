simple website for personal educational purposes.  

Layout is based on one of the exercises which I had from Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/kurs-web-developer-od-podstaw-w-15-dni/.
I'm not planning to do it 1:1 as in the course I would like to use animations, flexboxes and also JS. 

Any constructive feedback is welcome, please keep in my mind that I'm starting to build my front-end experience
